# AR-3D-E-Commerce
An AR-powered e-commerce prototype where each product has a unique QR code. Users can scan the QR to instantly view the product in Augmented Reality through their mobile camera using WebAR (A-Frame + AR.js). No app required — just scan, open, and visualize the 3D product in real space.
